# Summarizo

(First Version)


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecahintosh/Summarizo
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd Summarizo
```

Install dependencies and further in bash

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Now, if this doesn't run. This happens because of dependency locations being not there in the folder.

Find your streamlit file's location.

(Usually there in Scripts folder, named as streamlit.exe)

```bash
& "C:\Users\Shivansh\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python310\Scripts\streamlit.exe" run app.py
```
